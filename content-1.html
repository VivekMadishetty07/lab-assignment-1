                    <h4>General</h4>
                    By using this application, you acknowledge that the City provides the application as a service to
                    the
                    public on an "as is", "as available", basis. The City does not make any express or implied
                    warranties,
                    representations or endorsements with respect to the application. In particular, without limiting the
                    generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that the information provided through the application:

                    may not reflect the current balance of a Parking Violation Notice;
                    may not reflect the current status of a violation.
                    Although the City makes reasonable efforts to keep the information available through the application
                    up-to-date, errors can occur in recording some transactions, and delays can occur in reporting
                    information, affecting the accuracy of the information.

                    The City is not responsible for, and will not be liable to you or anyone else, for any damages
                    whatsoever, including any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, arising out of or
                    in
                    connection with your use of, or inability to use, the application.

                    By using this application, you agree that you will not (i) interfere with or disrupt the application
                    or
                    computer networks connected thereto; or (ii) delete or revise any materials or information
                    accessible
