            <p>Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of
                2,954,024 as of July 2018. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the
                majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's
                most populous CMA. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438
                people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario.[13] Toronto is an international centre
                of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and
                cosmopolitan cities in the world.[14][15][16]

                People have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau
                interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years.[17] After the
                broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown,[18]
                the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper
                Canada.[19] During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy
                damage by American troops.[20] York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was
                designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation.[21] The city
                proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its
                current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi).

                The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination
                for immigrants to Canada.[22][23] More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority
                population group,[24] and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.[25]
                While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are
                spoken in the city.[26]

                Toronto is a prominent centre for music,[27] theatre,[28] motion picture production,[29] and television
                production,[30] and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media
                outlets.[31] Its varied cultural institutions,[32] which include numerous museums and galleries,
                festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports
                activities,[33] attract over 43 million tourists each year.[34][35] Toronto is known for its many
                skyscrapers and high-rise buildings,[36] in particular the tallest free-standing structure in the
                Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower</p>
